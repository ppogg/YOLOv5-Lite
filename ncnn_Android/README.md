## how to build and run
### step1
https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/releases

* Download ncnn-YYYYMMDD-android-vulkan.zip or build ncnn for android yourself
* Extract ncnn-YYYYMMDD-android-vulkan.zip into **app/src/main/jni** and change the **ncnn_DIR** path to yours in **app/src/main/jni/CMakeLists.txt**

### step2
https://github.com/nihui/opencv-mobile

* Download opencv-mobile-XYZ-android.zip
* Extract opencv-mobile-XYZ-android.zip into **app/src/main/jni** and change the **OpenCV_DIR** path to yours in **app/src/main/jni/CMakeLists.txt**

### step3
* Open this project with Android Studio, build it and enjoy!

## some notes
* Android ndk camera is used for best efficiency
* Crash may happen on very old devices for lacking HAL3 camera interface
* All models are manually modified to accept dynamic input shape
* Most small models run slower on GPU than on CPU, this is common
* FPS may be lower in dark environment because of longer camera exposure time
